# gatsby-contentful-template

This is a template that can be re-used to quickly build gatsby sites with data provided by Contentful.

To get started:
1. Create a Contentful site (and a Space), and set your Space ID and Access Tokens up in environment variables
   - `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=`
   - `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=`
   - `CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=`
1. Modify graphql queries to work with your space
1. Modify html/jsx if necessary
1. Run `gatsby-develop`
